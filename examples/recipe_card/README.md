# **A Recipe Card-components**

> ### It's a simple and fun little `card-Component-design` which shows `A MEAL's information` in a beautiful visual design with a little bit complex animation in it, hope you'll like it. I think the animation is quite challenging part of this mini-project that will surely helps to think you a lot.

### While building, I try to focus on:

- Fully Responsive Design
- Clean Code and Independent (meaning component is Re-usable)
